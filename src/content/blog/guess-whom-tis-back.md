I lost the <a href="https://v1.sam.land" target="_blank">old website</a>, so here's a new one in a similar style.

A place to store my thoughts, learnings and projects. Should be fun, will see how it goes.

Made with <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</a>, <a href="https://hyper3d.ai/" target="_blank">Rodin</a> and <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">Three.js</a> using <a href="https://www.cursor.com/" target="_blank">Cursor</a> and deployed on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/" target="_blank">AWS Amplify</a>. Tutorial overview may be coming soon.
