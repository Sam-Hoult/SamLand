Ever noticed how there's not enough music about coding? Musicians write about what they know - love, heartbreak, partying, their struggles. But where are the anthems for developers spending countless hours debugging, the ballads about merge conflicts, or the power ballads celebrating that moment when the tests finally pass?

That's why I decided to have some fun with AI and create "I'm a Rockstar When I'm Coding" - a tongue-in-cheek tribute to the daily life of developers. Using various AI tools, I generated lyrics, music, and even vocals that capture the essence of our coding adventures.

Making this was fun, and it got me thinking about how we can use AI not just for practical coding tasks, but also to create fun content that celebrates our developer culture. Maybe we need more songs about coding - who's with me on starting an AI-powered developer band?

The video was created using my <a href="/blog/tutorial-if-santa-was-sober/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI music video workflow</a> that I've been refining.

The video footage is only really upscaled, and no colour correction. I kept it as simple as possible to be Text-to-Video that were mostly generated over night.

> I wear these big black shades when I code all night  
> My setup's like a spaceship with all these lights  
> My girl says  
> "You're a nerd"  
> but I disagree  
> 'Cause I'm a rockstar when I'm coding
> 
> [Chorus]  
> Yeah  
> I'm coding and hacking  
> And when the keyboards clackin'  
> I'm shredding  
> Man I can't stop  
> Oh  
> I'm coding and hacking  
> And when the keyboards clackin'  
> I'm shredding  
> Man I can't stop

[Verse]
I wear these big black shades when I code all night
My setup's like a spaceship with all these lights
My girl says
"You're a nerd"
but I disagree
'Cause I'm a rockstar when I'm coding

[Chorus]
Yeah
I'm coding and hacking
And when the keyboards clackin'
I'm shredding
Man I can't stop
Oh
I'm coding and hacking
And when the keyboards clackin'
I'm shredding
Man I can't stop
I'm a rockstar when I'm coding

[Verse]
And I just made a change that brought my app to life
Now I'm about to play my feature for my guys
In a circle
They can't believe what they're seein'
'Cause I'm a rockstar when I'm coding

[Chorus]
Yeah
I'm coding and hacking
And when the keyboards clackin'
I'm shredding
Man I can't stop
Oh
I'm coding and hacking
And when the keyboards clackin'
I'm shredding
Man I can't stop

[Bridge]
I've tried to fight it
But I can't control myself
All I wanna do is type
I got a nervous tick that might ruin my health
But I don't care
I'm livin' the life

[Chorus]
Oh
I'm coding and hacking
And when the keyboards clackin'
I'm shredding
Man I can't stop
Oh
I'm coding and hacking
And when the keyboards clackin'
I'm shredding
Man I can't stop
Oh
I'm coding and hacking
And when the keyboards clackin'
I'm shredding
Man I can't stop
I'm a rockstar when I'm coding
