An AI music video you really should check out for this article to make sense.

This video was made using AI and superb human taste. The audio was created from Suno, my current AI music generator of choice. The video clips were made by trying a couple of different text2vid (T2V) models, but when Hunyuan came out it reigned supreme.

I used ChatGPT to help generate a bunch of prompts to go along with the song lyrics, then ran a couple of different bulk runs on ComfyUI over the night then edited my favourite clips together on CapCut. I was leaving for a trip and wanted the video out so skipped doing upscaling, and used the BS budget CapCut upscaling which I don't recommend.

There were some lucid videos and many hallucid, which I kept in and cut down to keep the pace going. Overall making a music video within about 24 hours is pretty wild. I now have a new christmas song.
